📊 IoT Device Monitoring Dashboard
This project is a real-time IoT device monitoring dashboard built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to view live device data (e.g., temperature and humidity), while an admin console enables uploading simulated device data.

🔧 Features
🌐 Real-time Dashboard: Displays temperature and humidity from connected devices.

🧰 Admin Console: Allows admins to input and simulate device data.

🔁 Live Updates: Dashboard fetches the latest data every 5 seconds.

📡 MongoDB Atlas Integration: Secure cloud database for data persistence.

🚀 Modular Code: Clean architecture with separated backend and frontend.

🧠 Learning Goals
Use Mongoose to define schemas and interact with MongoDB Atlas.

Create RESTful APIs with proper error handling using Express.

Build responsive UIs using React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext).

Understand frontend-backend separation and real-time data fetching.

(Optional) Deploy using Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend).
